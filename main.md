# Demons and Daggers and Dicerolls: The Book of Adventures
A game of swords, sorcery, and spelunking

## Foreword
I'm eventually gonna write a long complicated foreword here, but the summary is something like this: Dungeons and Dragons is what got me into the tabletop gaming world, but it's...not great. There are some elements of D&D's design that are clunky, or confusing, or tilted too far in the direction of combat. Add to that the disasterous "preview" of the Open Game License version 1.1, and I'm basically done with D&D.

Which is why I decided to make my own game.

D&D&D is meant to be mostly compatible with Dungeons and Dragons. Some things will need to be tweaked, because I'm changing a few things here and there, but for the most part I expect your adventures will be easy to adapt. Hopefully, D&D&D can be the thing that gets people into tabletop, or at leas the thing that people who are already into tabletop can play instead of Wizards of the Coast's little mess.

## General Rules
### Rule Zero
You are here to have fun. More specifically, you and your fellow players are here to tell a collaborative story, but the main thing is that you're all here to have fun. The GM is here to be a referee, but his job is not to enforce rules, it is to ensure everyone's having fun; the rules are a tool that he (and you!) can use to create interesting stories, but if they get in the way, feel free to ignore them. Likewise, if someone at the table is causing trouble, it's more important to ensure that the rest of the players get to have fun too; feel free to call for a time-out and try to settle things like reasonable people. If you can't settle things like reasonable people, the group should probably stop playing until they can settle things. If all else fails, you may need to kick someone out. It sucks, but at the end of the day...the goal is for everyone at the table to have fun.

### Rule One
If there are no immediate consequences for failure, you shouldn't be rolling dice for it. The immediate consequences don't have to be health point loss, but they do have to be *consequences*. You shouldn't be rolling to see if you can make a sword while you're in town...*unless* you need to finish this sword by tomorrow to present it to the local lord. You shouldn't be rolling to pick up a mug of beer...*unless* you're in a barfight. You shouldn't be rolling to scale a cliff face *unless* there's a real risk that you'll fall off.

A corrollary of this is that *if you've prepared well enough, you don't need to roll*. If your party has already installed a rope system to transfer you and your loot up and down this cliff, you probably don't need to roll to climb the cliff, because you've already done all the hard work of making the cliff easy to climb…

...unless, of course, someone's tampered with the pulleys, or a goblin is hacking away at the rope near the top of the cliff, or a rainstorm has made everything slippery. But then again, maybe you're prepared for all that, too.

### The Override Rule
If text on a perk, or in a class's rules, contradicts the main rules--the class/perk rules take priority. This works like similar rules in trading card games. This does mean that someone can write a class or perk that does something way overpowered, but part of the GM's responsibility is deciding which classes and perks will be used in this game. (Not that being overpowered is bad by itself--as long as it doesn't overshadow the rest of the table.)

### Dice
You'll need many different sizes of dice. Most notably, you'll need a d20--a die with 20 sides on it. This is the die you roll most often, since it's used for skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. You will also need plenty of d6 (those are the six-sided ones that come with most boardgames). D4s, d8s, d10s, and d12s are also useful, but are less likely to be used.

### Rounding
Numbers are always rounded down. This is for consistency's sake.

There is only one exception: If an effect would result in you rounding your HP down to zero, you stay at 1 HP instead. In other words, *you cannot be knocked out by having your stats rounded down*.

## Character Creation
You're here to go on an adventure, right? Adventures require heroes. Here's how you come up with a hero:

### High Concept
You should probably start by deciding what kind of hero you want to play. Are you going to be a proud, noble knight? Or maybe a grouchier, battle-hardened knight. Or perhaps you're a sneaky rogue slipping into the shadows--or a dashing rogue who leaps into the fray and stuns his foes with feats of daring! Maybe you want to be a wizard whose spells turn the tables, or a witch who seeks to turn her curses against her foes. Knowing what you want ahead of time helps you make decisions later.

You can name your character at the start if you like; I like saving the name for the end, personally.

### Stats
There are six major stats that define what your character can do:
- Strength (STR) is a measure of a character's raw muscle power. A character with 1 Strength can barely lift their pack; a character with 20 Strength could potentially move a mountain if they put their back into it.
- Dexterity (DEX) is a measure of a character's ability to be nimble and quick. A character with 1 Dexterity might break the doorknob if they try to pick a lock; a character with 20 Dexterity could steal the crown off a king's head without him noticing.
- Constitution (CON) is a measure of a character's stamina and grit. A character with 1 Constitution may fall over if the wind gets too gusty; a character with 20 Constitution can shrug off boulders and poisons alike.
- Intelligence (INT) is a measure of a character's book-learning and studious nature. A character with 1 Intelligence can only read well enough to order drinks at the pub; a character with 20 Intelligence may have literally written the book on adventuring.
- Wisdom (WIS) is a measure of a character's intuition and their ability to make connections with limited information. A character with 1 Wisdom won't notice a trap unless it's pointed out to them; a character with 20 Wisdom can deduce the number of enemies present by how hastily the trap was assembled.
- Charisma (CHR) is a measure of a character's wit, charm, and ability to influence others. A character with 1 Charisma fears public speaking more than any monster of the underworld; a character with 20 Charisma could convince the king of the underworld that surrender is his best option.

Your character is not allowed to have any stat above 18 at character creation; this is because a good adventure involves growing stronger, and if you're already the best at something, you can't really get any better, can you?

Each of your stats grants a *Stat Bonus* to some of your d20 rolls. This *Stat Bonus* is equal to ½ the stat, rounded down. Put another way, every two points in a stat is a +1 on any rolls it applies to.

In addition, you also have a *Risk Limit* equal to the Stat Bonus of your highest stat (more on Risk in the *Taking Risks* section).

There are multiple ways to decide your character's stats, but the two most common examples are:

#### Point Buy
The *point buy* method gives each player a certain number of points to distribute among their stats. As mentioned above, you're not allowed to have more than 18 points in any one stat, but this system lets you choose exactly how many points go in each one.

The GM will tell you how many points you get to have. [insert list of point caps and relative power levels here]

#### 4d6, Drop One
The *4d6 drop one* method gives you randomized stats, but usually gives you pretty good numbers to work with. It's great for when you don't really want *exact* control over your character's stats, or if you want more interesting decisions to make than "which stat do I put 18 into". It works like this:

- Roll four d6.
- Remove the lowest number in the roll. Write down the total.
- Repeat this five more times, producing six random numbers.
- Assign each of the numbers you've generated to one of your stats.

### Picking a Combat Class
Your *Combat Class* is a broad description of what you do when swords are drawn and monsters are afoot. Some Combat Classes are *physical*, meaning they deal with swords, shields, bows, and other not-as-magical forms of violence. Others are *magical*, meaning they cast spells to aid their companions and assault their enemies.

Some common Combat Classes are listed in the *Book of Warriors* and the *Book of Magi*.

Your Combat Class gives you several things:
- Access to different Perk Lists. You'll learn more about this in the next section, but Perks grant you special abilities, effects, and other ways of bending the rules, and some Perks are limited to certain kinds of classes. You can pick one Perk for each Perk List your Combat Class gives you access to. Many Combat Classes have *Unique Perks* that are only available to that Class.
- A +2 to the stat that matters the most for that class. If the +2 would increase one of your stats past 18, you can either shuffle your stats around, or you can write down "extra stat boost" somewhere on your sheet and save it for later. You'll learn how to use it in the chapter on Leveling Up.
- A *Health Die*. Your Health Dice determine both how many Health Points you have, as well as how many Health Points you gain back when doing certain things. You have Health Points equal to the number of faces on the Health Die, times your character's Level--so if your Health Die is a d6, you have 6 Health Points at Level 1.
- One or more *Skill Bonuses* (more on these in a moment).

### Picking a Profession Class
Your *Profession Class* is what you do when you're not swinging a sword or waving a wand. Adventuring is a rough, messy job, and it involves a lot of careful planning, preparation, and hard work. You're not just slaying monsters; you're carting the loot around, making meals for your allies, studying ancient ruins, and disarming mysterious mechanisms.

Professions are listed in the *Book of Tradesmen*.

Your Profession Class gives you some things, just like the Combat Class:
- Access to more Perk Lists. Just like with the Combat Class, you can pick one Perk from each Perk List that your Profession Class gives you access to; if you picked a Profession Class with the same Perk Lists as your Combat Class, you can get access to more powerful Perks than you normally would have. Profession Classes can have *Unique Perks* just like Combat Classes do.
- A +2 to the stat that matters the most for your Profession Class. Just like with the Combat Class, if the +2 would increase one of your stats past 18, you can either shuffle the numbers around a bit or add another "extra stat boost" to your sheet.
- One or more Skill Bonuses.

Your Profession Class does not grant you a Health Die; after all, your Profession Class isn't about fighting, and doesn't make you better at fighting *directly*.

#### A Note About Tags
Profession Classes and Character Classes can have 'tags'. These are sometimes referred to in other rules. For now, just know that tags group CCs and PCs into broad categories, like "physical combat" classes that rely on striking the enemy with mundane weapons, or "food" classes that have something to do with preparing rations and meals.

### Choosing Perks
As mentioned in the Combat Class and Profession Class sections, you get to pick a certain number of Perks when you start out. Perks come from *Perk Lists*, which can be found in the *Book of Warriors*, *Book of Magi*, *Book of Tradesmen*, and the *Book of Adventure* (which you're reading right now!).

At character creation, you get to pick one Perk for every Perk List you're given access to. If you would be given access to a Perk List you've already got access to, you get to pick *two* Perks from that list--for example, if you create a character with the Combat Class *Elementalist* and the Profession Class *Scholar*, you'd get to pick two Perks from the Study Perk List, since both of those classes grant access to the Study Perk List.

In addition to the Perk Lists granted by your Combat Class and Profession Class, all characters get access to the Common Perk List, and get to pick one Perk from that list at character creation.

You get to pick one additional Perk from any list each time you level up. If you're generating a character at a higher level than 1, you get to pick those additional Perks now.

Some Perks are marked as "Repeatable". This means that you can take that Perk multiple times as your character levels up. This usually applies to Perks in the Common Perk List, particularly the ones that grant stat boosts, increased skill bonuses, or other numerical changes. Make sure to write down that you've added these Perks, though, so that you know why you have higher Strength than you started with.

Perks can *also* have tags, like Classes.

### Choosing Skill Bonuses
In addition to the Skill Bonuses you got from your Classes, you also get to choose two Skill Bonuses at character creation for free. Skill Bonuses are defined by a *condition* and a *bonus*. You can define the condition however you like, but the bonus is always +2 when you're just starting out. If one of your free Skill Bonuses is unusually specific, the GM may rule that you get a +4 in that Skill Bonus instead.

You'll learn more about how Skill Bonuses apply to rolls in the *Exploring the Dungeon* and *Getting In Fights* sections.

### Wrapping It Up
At this point, you have a fully functional character! But there's a few more things you'll probably want for your adventure.

Characters start with 1 Wealth Rank (more on Wealth Ranks in the *Items, Wealth, and Shops* section). They also start with a non-magical weapon of your choice (and optionally a shield), a set of non-magical armor of your choice, the equipment used by their Profession Class, and some miscellaneous adventuring gear (rope, a backpack, torches, and so on). If you're not sure if your character would have something, ask the GM if you can have it; they'll tell you if it's something you can reasonably get, or if you might need to spend your Wealth Rank to get it.

If you haven't come up with a name yet, you may want to come up with one now. If you can't think of a name, feel free to ask for suggestions.

If you come up with any neat details about your character's past, you probably want to write them down. Don't forget to tell the GM, so they can work the details into the adventure--maybe you have a nemesis, or a long-lost friend, or a family you swore to protect.


## Taking Risks
Some actions you take will produce, consume, or manipulate Risk Dice. Risk Dice represent how close your character is to making a careless mistake; once you have too many Risk Dice, you start suffering dire consequences for failure.

Your character has a Risk Limit equal to ½ their highest stat, rounded down. (Another way of looking at this: Your character's Risk Limit is equal to their highest Stat Bonus.) *As long as the number of Risk Dice you have is equal to or less than your Risk Limit*, nothing bad will happen.

However, *if you have more Risk Dice than your Risk Limit*, your character is at risk of a more dangerous form of failure. *When you fail a roll*, if you have more Risk Dice than your Risk Limit, you suffer a *Risk Consequence* based on what you were trying to do. Once you've resolved the Risk Consequence, remove all the Risk Dice you were holding.

Certain Perks specify different Risk Consequences for certain actions, but there are a few general kinds of Consequences:

### Physical, Non-Combat: Sprain
You overexert yourself, suffering a minor injury that impedes your actions. You suffer a -2 penalty to all rolls until you either finish a combat encounter or go to sleep. This can stack with itself.

### Magical, Non-Combat: Fizzle
The spell you were weaving falls apart, venting some magical energy in a potentially dangerous way. Choose one: give a party member half your Risk Dice; mark one of your magic items as unusable until you go to sleep; destroy a mundane item; or take 1d4 damage from arcane backlash.

### Physical, Combat: Stumble
You overextend, trip, or otherwise leave yourself open. You take one less action next turn. Enemies who attack you get to roll twice and take the higher result until the start of your next turn.

### Magical, Combat: Omen
Your spell collapses into a wave of bad luck. All characters in the same combat zone as you gain Risk Dice equal to half your Risk Dice.

## Exploring The Dungeon
The bulk of the game is going to happen in various strange and dimly-lit ruins, castles, tunnels, mazes, forests, and other spooky locations--in short, dungeons.

Don't be fooled, though--while there's plenty of danger to be had in dungeons, monsters are merely one part of the experience. Horrifying mechanisms of death, rotting structures collapsing under your feet, roaring underground rivers, dizzying sheer cliffs--even mundane things like cold, hunger, and thirst are concerns when you're travelling this far from civilization.

### Skill Checks
Most of the time, if you're doing something risky, it's gonna involve a *Skill Check*. Your GM might tell you, "Roll a Strength check, target number 15", or "Give me a Dex check, target 15, at +4 because they're distracted", or "Give me a Wis check, TN 10, with a minus 6 because you're choking on the smoke".

Skill checks have three important components:
1. Which stat applies to the check. Any skill check will require a stat. If the stat isn't specified by a Perk or by the thing you're trying to do, the GM decides what applies. You add this stat's Stat Bonus to your roll.
2. The "target number". You need to roll equal to or higher than this number on a d20 to succeed.
3. Any bonuses or penalties you get for the situation. You might get a bonus if you're taking advantage of the environment or if you planned especially for this, or a penalty if you're caught off-guard or are putting an especially difficult twist on something that already has a set target number. Bonuses get added to your roll, penalties get subtracted. If the GM doesn't tell you there's a bonus or penalty, assume there isn't one.

Finally, if you have a Skill Bonus that applies to this situation, you can add it to your roll. You only get to add one Skill Bonus per roll, so you'll probably want to use your highest one.

> For example, Carn is a mighty barbarian (CC: Veteran, PC: Survivalist) who is currently tracking a monster. If he succeeds, he'll find out what kind of monster it is and where it's hiding, letting his party get the upper hand if they have to fight it (or avoid it if they want). If he fails, the monster might find *him* instead--or if he's lucky, it'll get spooked and flee the area, which will be disappointing, but won't get anybody hurt.
> Carn's GM describes a trail of pawprints through the mud and dust of the dungeon floor, with ominous claw marks across some of the pillars. Then the GM asks for a Wisdom skill check with a target number of 10--this monster may be dangerous, but it's not covering its tracks very well!
> Carn points out that he has a Skill Bonus of +2 for "Find animals in the wild". The GM says that he can use it.
> Carn also has a Wisdom of 12. He's no wizard, but he's no fool either, so his Wisdom Stat Bonus is +6.
> He rolls a d20, which comes up as a 4--rotten luck! But Carn adds +2 from his Skill Bonus and +6 from his Wisdom Stat Bonus. 4 plus 2 plus 6 is 12--and that's higher than the target number.
> The GM informs Carn that this beast's claw marks are in specific patterns, indicating that this is the territory markings of a local gnoll tribe. There's only one set of tracks because their patrols march in single file to hide their numbers. Carn brings this news back to camp, warning his allies.

### Perks, Profession Classes, and Downtime
Your Profession Class is meant to give you something to do while you're crawling through the caverns, searching for traps, or waiting for your wizard to dispel a ward. Because of this, the Perks you gain through your Profession Class typically tell you that you can do something "during Downtime".

*Downtime* is the time you have in between travelling and fighting. Broadly speaking, if you can sit down and rest for about half an hour safely, you are in Downtime, and you can do something that requires Downtime.

There is no hard limit on how much stuff you can do during Downtime, though be aware that the GM *will* take note of how much time you're spending on sharpening your blades or cooking up fresh meals. The GM may even have local monsters spring an ambush on your camp!

### Critical Hits, Critical Failures, and Risk
If the result of the d20 is a 20 before you add or subtract anything (commonly known as a *natural 20*), you've rolled a *Critical Hit*! Critical Hits enable you to perform incredible feats both on and off the battlefield.

When you roll a Critical Hit on a non-combat Skill Check, you automatically succeed on the skill check, *and* you get double the effect out of whatever you were doing. If the thing you were trying to do isn't something you can reasonably double--for example, if you were trying to understand a set of ancient runes, or to disarm a trap--then the GM can decide on some other benefit to offer you, such as a bonus to future skill checks or a treasure that you wouldn't have found otherwise.

However, you can choose to *downgrade* a Critical Hit in order to clear two Risk Dice. If you do, treat the roll as a regular hit. You still automatically succeed, even if your roll normally wouldn't have been enough to succeed.

On the other hand, if the result of the d20 is a *natural 1* (that is, you roll a 1 before adding or subtracting anything), then you've rolled a *critical failure*. This means something goes very, very wrong--and the GM gets to decide *how* things go very, very wrong. This usually means something bad happens to you.

However, you can choose to take 2 Risk Dice to *upgrade* from a critical failure to a regular failure. You still failed the roll, but you don't suffer any severe issues...unless you're over your Risk Limit, anyway.

You can also upgrade a regular failure to a success by taking 3 Risk Dice. However, you can only upgrade a roll once; you can't go from critfail to fail to success on the same roll by taking 5 Risk, even if you have a high enough Risk Limit for that. Furthermore, you can't upgrade a Success to a Critical Success, no matter how risky you're willing to be.
