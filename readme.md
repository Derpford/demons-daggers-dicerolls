# Demons and Daggers and Dicerolls
A sword-and-sorcery tabletop RPG built to be (mostly) compatible with that d20 system.

## Why?
Well, first of all, I've always felt that modern editions of D&D were pushing too far in the direction of being pure tactics games. Part of what I loved about my first experiences with D&D was that it was as much about puzzles, environmental storytelling, and clever solutions as it was about positioning, party tactics, and combat build theorizing.

Second of all, when the Open Game License 1.1 leaked, it became very clear very fast that nobody trusts Wizards of the Coast anymore--for good reasons. Some of the text of OGL1.1 is on par with the kind of things you see in EULAs, but some of it is overbroad, some of it is unprecedented, and *all* of it was questionable because of the short timeframe (and, despite WotC's insistence that they wanted feedback, it seemed that their plan was to put it into effect without seeking any feedback at all).

To be clear: This is probably more Hasbro's doing than WotC's. I suspect Hasbro is pressuring WotC to make more money, to keep the rest of Hasbro afloat--and Hasbro is likely taking advantage of WotC's status as a subsidiary to keep the blame well away from Hasbro's executives.

But...the old-school titan, Dungeons and Dragons, is on its last legs. The ecosystem built around D&D has been shaken by OGL 1.1, and when the people who made that ecosystem run start fleeing to other systems, D&D will suffer greatly for it. Half the reason Dungeons and Dragons is so popular is because of the user-made content built around it.

So I might as well take my shot at making something better, right?

## What do you mean, "mostly compatible"?
One of my goals with this project is to minimize the amount of effort needed to adapt D&D content to Demons and Daggers and Dicerolls. However, there's some changes that I *am* making for various reasons. 

For example, in D&D&D, there's a distinction between *Combat* Classes and *Profession* Classes, and you get to have one of each at level 1--because I wanted to shift the focus of the game more towards non-combat content, and I figured a good way to do that was to get rid of the opportunity cost and let players be good at *both* combat *and* utility at the same time.

Obviously, most of the content made for D&D assumes D&D's class system is in use, which means they don't distinguish between combat and non-combat classes or class features--so adapting classes from D&D to D&D&D can range from simple (Ninja is obviously a combat class, whereas certain implementations of Alchemist are more obviously non-combat class) to complex (Ranger mixes combat with utility, so is it a Combat Class or a Profession Class?).

Or, another good example is Risk Dice. Risk Dice are my attempt to create a resource economy that can make sense for both martials and casters, so that martials and casters can have similar power levels in combat without completely screwing casters, and martials can have more interesting interactions than "hit thing with sword" without de-facto turning them into casters. Obviously, classes created for D&D are not designed around this mechanic.

However, I *am* trying to maintain parity with a bunch of other things. I've changed the stat bonus to Â½ the stat rounded down, instead of the shifted-down-by-5 table that D&D uses, and I've added the ability modifier to skill checks, but it's still a d20 roll against a target number. You still have six stats and they're still on the 3-18 scale at character creation. Most of the things you'd call "class features" have been combined with feats into the "perk" system, but there's still unique effects that each class gets. You still have Hit Dice (well, Health Dice, but they're the same thing). Overall, D&D&D *should* play like D&D, albeit with player characters who are somewhat more powerful at level 1 and combat rules that don't rely as much on there being a grid map.

## Where is everything?

main.md, also known as the *Book of Adventure*, contains the character creation rules and the basic rules for conflict resolution.

Other books will be added as I write them.

## Can I make my own content for this system?
Absolutely! You should probably wait until my rules are mostly finished and written down, but feel free to write your own classes, perk lists, equipment stats, adventures, and any other content you like. I intend to license this system under the [*Open RPG Creative License*](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7v) when that's finished. Until then, I'm granting a broad license to use this system and create addons for this system. (I reserve the right to revoke this license on an individual basis.)
